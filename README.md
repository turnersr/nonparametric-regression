# nonparametric 

This library implements several methods from nonparametric statistics. Currently can compute kernel density estimator based on the FFT method. It can also compute nonparametric regressions for several kernels using the simple computationally expensive approach. Future plans will include spatial data structure and nearest neighbor.
